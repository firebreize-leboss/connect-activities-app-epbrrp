The bottom navigation has five tabs: Profile, Browse, Activity, Category, and Chat.\r\n\r\nIn Profile, users see their photo, name, bio, city, and interests, and can access settings to edit their info, adjust preferences like distance or categories, and manage privacy or notifications. The Browse tab shows a scrollable feed of cards representing local activities, each with an image, title, host, date, location, and available spots. Tapping a card opens a detail page with a photo, description, categories, participants, and a \u201cJoin\u201d or \u201cLeave\u201d button (changing to \u201cFull\u201d when there are no spots left).\r\n\r\nThe Activity tab displays events the user has joined, split into \u201cOngoing\u201d and \u201cPast\u201d sections using a segmented switch. Each event appears as a card linking to its details or its related group chat. The Category tab shows a grid of activity types (like Hiking, Brunch, Music, Cinema, Games), and selecting one filters the list of activities in that theme.\r\n\r\nThe Chat tab offers private and group messaging. There are direct chats with friends and group chats automatically created for joined activities. Each chat shows the name, image, last message, and time. Inside, messages appear in simple chat bubbles with text and images.\r\n\r\nUsers can also create activities through a form with title, description, image, date/time, location, capacity, and category. The creator becomes the host and is added to the activity\u2019s chat. The app supports search and filters by category, distance, date, or spots available, adding friends, and push notifications for activity reminders or new messages.\r\n\r\nThe visual identity should reflect Too Good To Go\u2019s calm, modern feel: dark background (#121212), green action color (#2ECC71), white text, and full-width rounded cards. The goal is a smooth, elegant, and social experience where users can explore, join, and discuss activities easily in a friendly, dynamic interface."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.

Implement the card detail page with a \"Join/Leave/Full\" button.\n*   **Profile Screen:** Build the Profile screen to display user information (photo, name, bio, city, interests) and a settings access point.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#121212`\n    *   Text: `#FFFFFF`\n    *   TextSecondary: `#A0A0A0`\n    *   Primary: `#2ECC71` (Green accent color)\n    *   Secondary: `#3498DB`\n    *   Accent: `#F39C12`\n    *   Card: `#1E1E1E`\n    *   Highlight: `#27AE60`\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n*   **UI Elements:** Implement rounded cards, smooth animations, and a clean, minimalist layout.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Verify the project structure and dependencies.\n2.  **Theme Implementation:** Define a dark theme using React Navigation's theming capabilities and apply the specified color palette.\n3.  **Bottom Navigation:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to implement the five-tab bottom navigation using `FloatingTabBar.tsx`.\n4.  **Browse Tab:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to create the scrollable feed of activity cards.\n5.  **Profile Tab:** Create a basic `ProfileScreen` in `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to display user information.\n6.  **Activity, Category, and Chat Tabs:** Create placeholder screens for these tabs to establish the basic navigation structure.\n7.
